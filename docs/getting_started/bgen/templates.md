Templates control how scripts for benchmarking are generated. Run templates
(`.sh` scripts) are used for individual benchmark runs, while dist templates
(`.dist` scripts) serve distributed computation on clusters.

You can browse a curated collection of example templates in the [benchmark-tool
repository].

## Run Templates

Run templates define how each benchmark instance is executed. During script
generation, references within the template (e.g., `run.files`) are replaced
with corresponding values.

The following references are available:

- `run.files`: instance files
- `run.encodings`: encoding files used for this instance
- `run.root`: path to the benchmark-tool folder
- `run.timeout`: walltime for this run
- `run.memout`: memory limit for this run in MB (default: 20000)
- `run.solver`: solver or program used for this run
- `run.args`: additional arguments for the solver/program

Most templates use the [runlim] program to supervise benchmark runs.

## Dist Templates

Dist templates define how jobs are grouped and executed on a cluster, including
job parameters such as walltime, environment setup, and job scheduling order.

Parameters can be set using the standard SLURM `#SBATCH` syntax.

The following references are available:

- `walltime`: overall time limit
- `cpt`: number of CPUs per task
- `partition`: cluster partition to use
- `dist_options`: additional options for distributed jobs (e.g., SLURM)
- `jobs`: list of jobs to run
